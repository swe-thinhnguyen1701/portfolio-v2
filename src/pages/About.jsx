            <p>Hi My name is Thinh Nguyen, and I also go by Charles. I am a passionate and dedicated full stack developer with a strong foundation in applied mathematics, having earned my bachelor's degree from San Jose State University. Currently, I am furthering my expertise by taking a full-stack developer bootcamp at UC Berkeley.<br />
                I am proficient in a variety of programming languages including Java, JavaScript, Python, Lua, HTML, and CSS. In terms of databases, I have experience with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and AWS DynamoDB. Additionally, I am well-versed in Node.js, Express, React, and several AWS technologies such as AWS Lambda and AWS Gateway. <br />
                Although I am relatively new to the professional field, I have completed several projects during my time at the UC Berkeley bootcamp, as well as personal projects that have allowed me to hone my skills and develop a deeper understanding of full-stack development.<br />
                Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy swimming and playing basketball. These activities help me maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle, and they also provide me with opportunities to connect with others and have fun.<br />
                I am enthusiastic about the future and look forward to contributing to innovative projects and working with talented teams to create impactful solutions.
