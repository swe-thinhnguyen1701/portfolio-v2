            <p>Hi I'm Charles Nguyen, a Full-Stack Developer. I graduated from San Jose State University in 2022 with a
                degree
                in Applied Computational Mathematics with an emphasis in Software Programming. I am currently enhancing
                my
                skills by taking Full-Stack Development bootcamp at the University of California, Berkeley. <br /><br />
                I enjoy building dynamic creative products from beginning to end. My focus is on developing intuitive
                experiences that consistently grow and improve based on user metrics.Creating a user friendly app like
                the Note
                Taker; this application allows users to take, save, and trash the notes by utilizing express.js and
                node.js.
            </p>
